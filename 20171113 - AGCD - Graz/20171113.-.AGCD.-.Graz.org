* Greatest Common Divisors

** Euclidean algorithm

Given two integers $a, b < N = 2^κ$ the Euclidean algorithm computes their greatest common divisor $\gcd(a,b)$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
#+END_SRC

The Euclidean algorithm runs in time $\bigO{κ^2}$.

Best known algorithm runs in time $\bigO{κ \log^2 κ \log\log κ}$. footfullcite:ANTS:SteZim04

For comparison, integer multiplication costs $\bigO{κ \log κ \log\log κ}$ using the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm.

* RSA

** Public key encryption

-  KeyGen :: Bob generates a key pair $(sk, pk)$ and publishes $pk$.

-  Enc :: Alice uses $pk$ to encrypt message $m$ for Bob as \(c\).

-  Dec :: Bob uses \(sk\) to decrypt \(c\) to recover \(m\).

** Naive RSA

- KeyGen :: The public key is $(N,e)$ and the private key is $d$, with

  - $N = p \cdot q$ where $p$ and $q$ prime,
  - $e$ coprime to $\phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1)$ and
  - $d$ such that $e \cdot d \equiv 1 \mod{φ(N)}$.

- Enc :: $c \equiv m^e \bmod{N}$

- Dec :: $m \equiv c^d \equiv m^{e \cdot d} \equiv m^{1} \bmod{N}$
 
** Naive RSA is not IND-CCA secure

- Assume we want to decrypt $c \equiv m^e \bmod N$ with access to an oracle which will decrypt any ciphertext but $c$.

- Pick a random $s \bmod N$ and compute $c' \equiv s^e ⋅ c \bmod N$

- Submit $c'$ to the decryption oracle to recover $m' \equiv {\left(s^e ⋅ c\right)}^d$

- It holds that

  \[m' \equiv {\left(s^e ⋅ c\right)}^d \equiv {\left(s^e ⋅ m^e\right)}^d \equiv {\left({\left(s⋅m\right)}^e \right)}^d \equiv s⋅m \bmod N\]

- Such an oracle can essentially be instantiated using error messages. footfullcite:C:Bleichenbacher98

** Classical attacks on RSA

- An adversary who can factor large integers can break RSA.

- The best known classical algorithm for factoring is the Number Field Sieve (NFS)

- It has a *super-polynomial* but *sub-exponential* (in $\log N$ ) complexity of \[\bigO{e^{1.9 (\log^{1/3} N) (\log\log^{2/3} N)}}\] operations.

*** Caution

This does not mean an adversary _has_ to factor to solve RSA.

* The GCD attack on bad random numbers  
** Much randomness

- When we generate RSA moduli, we need to sample two good prime numbers of bitsize $κ/2$
- The probability that a random number of bitsize $κ/2$ is prime, is about $1/κ$.
- To sample an RSA modulus we hence need about $κ^2$ random bits. For $κ = 1024$ this means about $10^6$ random bits.
- Where do we get all these bits from?

** Collecting entropy

Random bits can be gathered from the environment using various sensors, e.g.

-  time,
-  process IDs currently running on the machine,
-  the harddisk,
-  the content of uninitialised memory,
-  hardware sensors (temperature etc.).

** What could possibly go wrong?

Assume a router generating an RSA modulus on booting for the first time.

- It might not know the time but retrieve it once booted.
- Whenever it boots the same processes are running.
- The harddisk has the same files on it for every router.
- Uninitialised memory is just full of zeros.
- There are perhaps no hardware sensors.

All routers of the same make might (in fact, some do) generate the *same* RSA modulus.

** What could possibly go wrong?

If two routers compute the same $N = p \cdot q$ then their respective users can read each other’s traffic.

** What could possibly go wrong?

What if two routers generate moduli $N_0 = q_0 ⋅ p$ and $N_1 = q_1 \cdot p$, i.e. moduli with shared factors, due to bad randomness?

- We assume that factoring each of $N_0$ or $N_1$ is hard.
- On the other hand, computing $\gcd(N_0, N_1)$ reveals $p$ but costs only $\bigO{\log^2 N}$ operations.

** Computing pairwise GCDs efficiently

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- Naively, we’d have to compute $\bigO{\tau^2}$ GCDs to check all $\tau$ moduli against each other.
- We can do better by performing \(\tau\) GCD computations \[\gcd(N_i, \prod_{j \neq i} N_j)\]
- We will use the identity[fn:1] \[x \bmod N_0 \equiv (x \bmod N_0⋅N_1) \bmod N_0\]

** Computing pairwise GCDs efficiently

Let, for example, $\tau = 4$.

* The Approximate GCD problem
** Quantum attacks on RSA

An adversary with access to a quantum computer with \[ \bigO{\log^2(N) \log\log (N) \log\log\log (N)}\] gates can factor $N$ using Shor’s algorithm.footfullcite:FOCS:Shor94

** The Approximate GCD problem

The *Approximate GCD* problem is the problem of distinguishing \[x_i = q_i ⋅ p  \alert{+ r_i}\] from uniform $\ZZ ∩ [0, X)$ with $x_i < X$.

** The Approximate GCD problem

\[x_i = q_i ⋅ p  + r_i\]

** Naive encryption

- KeyGen :: The public key is $\{x_i = q_i ⋅ p + 2\,r_i\}_{0 ≤ i < t}$ and the private key is $p$.

- Enc :: For $m \in \{0,1\}$ output $c = m + \sum b_i ⋅ x_i$ with $b_i \sample \{0,1\}$.

- Dec :: $m = (c \bmod p) \bmod 2$.

*** Caution

This encryption scheme has the same malleability property as naive RSA encryption![fn:2]

* Attacks on the Approximate GCD problem

** Exhaustive search

Given $x_0 = q_0 ⋅ p + r_0$ and $x_1 + q_1 ⋅ p + r_1$ we know that \[p \mid \gcd\left((x_0 - r_0), (x_1 - r_1)\right)\]


Guess $r_0$ and $r_1$!

*** Cost

$2^{2ρ}$ GCDs

** Exhaustive search + multiplication

Compute \[\gcd\left(x_0', \prod_{i=0}^{2^ρ-1} (x_1 - i) \bmod x_0'\right)\] for all $x_0' = x_0 - j$ with $0 \leq j < 2^{ρ-1}$.

*** Cost

$2^ρ$ GCDs, $2^{2ρ}$ multiplications

** Time-Memory Trade Off: Multiplication

Assume that we have $τ$ samples $x_0 , … ,x_{τ-1}$ of a given prime $p$, of the hidden form $x_i = q_i ⋅ p + r_i$, then $p$ can then be recovered with overwhelming probability in time $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(2^{\frac{τ+1}{τ-1}ρ})$. footfullcite:EC:CorNacTib12

The algorithm proceeds by computing \[y_i = \prod_{j=0}^{2^ρ-1} (x_i - j)\] for $0 ≤ i < τ$. Each $y_i$ can be computed in quasilinear time in $2^{ρ}$, i.e. \[\bigO{2^ρ ⋅ γ \cdot \log^2 (2^ρ ⋅ γ) \cdot \log \log (2^ρ ⋅ γ)}\] using a product tree.

** Time-Memory Trade Off: GCD

We have \[p \mid \gcd(y_0, … , y_{τ-1}).\]

The GCD can be evaluated as \[\gcd(\cdot \cdot \cdot \gcd(\gcd(y_0, y_1), y_2), … , y_{\tau-1})\] using $\tau - 1$ quasilinear GCD computations on numbers of size $\bigO{2^{ρ} · γ} = \bigsoftO{2^{ρ}}$, i.e. the total cost of this step is \[\bigO{\tau \cdot 2^ρ ⋅ γ \cdot \log^2 (2^ρ ⋅ γ) \cdot \log \log (2^ρ ⋅ γ)}.\]

Hence, the whole computation of the GCD takes time \[\bigO{\tau \cdot 2^ρ ⋅ γ \cdot \log^2 (2^ρ ⋅ γ) \cdot \log \log (2^ρ ⋅ γ)}.\]

** Time-Memory Trade Off: Filtering

- The GCD $g$ will be much bigger than $p$.
- But with high probability over the choice of the $(q_i , r_i)$, all the prime factors of $g$ except $p$ are smaller than some bound $B$ that is not much larger than $2^{ρ}$.
- Thus, $p$ can be recovered as $g/g'$, where $g'$ is the \(B\)-smooth part of $g$, which can in turn be computed in quasilinear time in $\max(B, \log g)$, e.g. using Bernstein’s algorithm footfullcite:Bernstein04. 

Overall, the full time complexity of the attack is thus \[\bigO{\tau \cdot 2^ρ ⋅ γ \cdot \log^2 (2^ρ ⋅ γ) \cdot \log \log (2^ρ ⋅ γ)}\] assuming $B$ has size about $2^\rho$.

** Lattice attacks

Given \(x_0  = q_0 p + r_0\) and \(x_1  = q_1 p + r_1\), consider

\begin{eqnarray*}
q_0 x_1 - q_1 x_0 & = & q_0 (q_1 p + r_1) - q_1 (q_0 p - r_0)\\
                  & = & q_0 q_1 p + q_0 r_1 - q_1 q_0 p - q_1 r_0\\
& = & q_0 r_1 - q_1 r_0
\end{eqnarray*}

and note that \[q_0 x_1 - q_1 x_0 \ll x_i\]

#+BEAMER: \pause

*** Non-starter?

We don’t know $q_i$!
** Lattice attacks

Consider the matrix 

\[\vec{B} = \begin{pmatrix}
2^{\rho + 1}  & x_1  & x_2   & \cdots  & x_t\\
              & -x_0 &       &         & \\
              &      &  -x_0 &         & \\
              &      &       &  \ddots & \\
              &      &       &         &  -x_0\\
\end{pmatrix}\]

multiplying on the left by the vector $\vec{q} = (q_0, q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_t)$ gives
\begin{align*}
\vec{v} &= (q_0, q_1, \cdots, q_t) \cdot \vec{B} \\
        &= (q_0\, 2^{ρ+1}, q_0 x_1 - q_1 x_0, \cdots, q_0 x_t - q_t x_0)\\
        &= (q_0\, \alert{2^{ρ+1}}, q_0 \alert{r_1} - q_1 \alert{r_0}, \cdots, q_0 \alert{r_t} - q_t \alert{r_0})
\end{align*}
which is a vector with small coefficients compared to $x_i$.

** Finding short vectors

Te set of all integer-linear combinations of the rows of $\vec{B}$ the *lattice* spanned by (the rows of) $\vec{B}$.

- SVP :: finding a *shortest* non-zero vector on *general* lattices is NP-hard.

- Gap-SVP\(_\gamma\) :: Differentiating between instances of SVP in which the answer is at most 1 or larger than $\gamma$ on *general* lattices is a well-known and presumed quantum-hard problem for $\gamma$ polynomial in lattice dimension.

*** Easy SVP

GCD is SVP on the integer lattice $\ZZ$. For example, $\vec{B} = {[21, 14]}^T$, $\vec{v} = (-1,1)$, $\vec{v} ⋅\vec{B} = 7$.

** Reduction to presumed hard lattice problem

We can show that an adversary *has* to solve Gap-SVP.

If there is an algorithm efficiently solving the AGCD problem then there exists an algorithm which solves the _Learning with Errors_ (LWE) problem with essentially the same performance. footfullcite:EC:CheSte15 

*** LWE → Gap-SVP

If there is an algorithm efficiently solving the LWE problem then there exists a quantum algorithm which solves worst-case Gap-SVP instances.footfullcite:STOC:Regev05

** From vectors to scalars

LWE with modulus \(q^n\) and dimension \(1\) is as hard as LWE with modulus \(q\) and dimension \(1\).

\[q^{d-1} \cdot \Angle{\vec{a},\vec{s}} \approx \left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} q^{i} \cdot a_{i}\right) \cdot \left(\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} q^{d-i-1} \cdot s_{i}\right) \bmod q^{d} = \tilde{a} \cdot \tilde{s} \bmod q^{d}.\]

&\equiv q(a_0\cdot s_0 + a_1 \cdot s_1) + (a_1 \cdot s_1) \bmod q^2\\
&\approx q(a_0\cdot s_0 + a_1 \cdot s_1) \bmod q^2
